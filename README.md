## A Stochastic Model of Gut-Brain Axis Dynamics with Microbiome Interactions

## Project Description

StochasticGutBrainModel is a computational simulation framework that explores the complex interactions between the gut microbiome, metabolites, hormones, and neural signaling in the gut-brain axis. Unlike deterministic models, this project incorporates stochastic dynamics to capture the inherent randomness and noise in biological systems, revealing emergent behaviors and critical transitions that might be missed by traditional approaches.

This model simulates:

- **Gut hormonal signaling** (GLP-1, Ghrelin) and their effect on energy homeostasis
- **Bacterial community dynamics** using Lotka-Volterra equations for interspecies competition/cooperation
- **Microbial metabolite production** (SCFAs: Butyrate, Propionate, Acetate)
- **Neural signaling** via the vagus nerve
- **External perturbations** like dietary changes, antibiotics, and stress
- **Critical transitions and bistability** in both host and microbial systems

This is a hobby project created out of curiosity and interest in complex biological systems. The model is not intended to make clinical predictions but rather to explore theoretical dynamics and generate hypotheses about the gut-brain axis.

## Dependencies

The model requires the following Python packages:

```
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
pandas
```

Optional (for network visualization):
```
networkx
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StochasticGutBrainModel.git
cd StochasticGutBrainModel
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas networkx
```

## Model Structure & Assumptions

The model consists of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) representing:

1. **Host Systems**:
   - Hormonal dynamics (GLP-1, ghrelin)
   - Vagal nerve signaling
   - Energy homeostasis

2. **Microbiome Systems**:
   - Bacterial community dynamics using Lotka-Volterra equations
   - Species interactions (competition, facilitation)
   - Metabolite production and degradation

3. **Environmental Perturbations**:
   - Dietary inputs (fiber, protein, fat)
   - Antibiotic treatments
   - Stress responses

Key assumptions:
- Multiplicative noise in biological variables (noise scales with concentration)
- Non-linear feedback mechanisms that can create bistability
- Species-specific production of microbial metabolites
- Simplified representation of diet composition effects on bacterial growth

## Usage Examples

### Basic Simulation

```python
# Create model with specified parameters
model = StochasticGutBrainModel({
    'fiber_intake': 0.6,
    'sigma_bacteria': 0.05
})

# Run simulation
t, y = model.simulate_sde(t_span=(0, 200), dt=0.05, seed=42)

# Visualize results
fig = model.visualize_simulation(t, y, title="Baseline Gut-Brain Dynamics")
plt.show()
```

### Antibiotic Perturbation Experiment

```python
# Simulate antibiotic treatment
abx_results = model.simulate_antibiotic_perturbation(
    antibiotic_start=50,
    antibiotic_duration=30,
    recovery_duration=150,
    antibiotic_strength=0.8
)

# Visualize results
fig = model.visualize_antibiotic_experiment(abx_results)
plt.show()
```

### Dietary Shift Experiment

```python
# Simulate dietary changes
diet_results = model.simulate_diet_shifts([
    {'time': 0, 'fiber': 0.2, 'protein': 0.6, 'fat': 0.7},   # Low-fiber, high-fat diet
    {'time': 100, 'fiber': 0.8, 'protein': 0.3, 'fat': 0.2}, # High-fiber, low-fat diet
    {'time': 200, 'fiber': 0.5, 'protein': 0.5, 'fat': 0.5}  # Balanced diet
], duration=100)

# Visualize results
fig = model.visualize_diet_experiment(diet_results)
plt.show()
```

## Disclaimer

This is a hobby project created by an enthusiast with an interest in complex biological systems and computational modeling. It is not intended to be used for medical purposes or to make clinical predictions. The model is based on theoretical principles and simplified representations of biological systems.

I am not a professional researcher in this field, just a curious individual exploring these concepts with the help of computational tools and large language models. The code and underlying model should be considered speculative and for educational purposes only.

Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome!
